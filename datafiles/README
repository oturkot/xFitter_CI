### Data tables in xFitter format ###

The data tables are grouped according to the collider, experiment and process,
such that the path to a data sets looks like:
colliderName/experimentName/processType/arxivNumber/

By default only HERA data are provided (as used in EPJC75 (2015) no.12, 580) 
together with the xFitter package. In order to download other datasets (LHC, 
Tevatron, etc) please use tools/xfitter-getdata.sh scipt, also available in 
xfitter.org release download web page 
(type ./xfitter-getdata.sh --help for instructions how to use it).
